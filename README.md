### Development Guidelines

- Follow Rust coding conventions
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits clean and well-documented

## Known Issues üêõ

- Due to the current limitation of `teloxide_tests`, we have to use the default `Bot` in `BotService` without any adapters. See [here](https://github.com/LasterAlex/teloxide_tests/issues/25) for more details.
- User input is automatically processed by Telegram, currently we restore the display text back to the raw text, which is most likely not the perfect solution.

## Security üîí

- User credentials are never stored permanently
- Messages containing sensitive information are automatically deleted
- Session tokens are stored securely
- Group chat access is blocked
